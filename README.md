LingLong is a flexible proposer commitment framework that enables Ethereum validators to trustlessly delegate commitment generation to specialized entities, without transferring operational control. Through its modular design, LingLong orchestrates commitment generation, data availability management, and auxiliary functions to create a streamlined process for variety of proposer commitment, such as preconfirmation, data availability, and more.
